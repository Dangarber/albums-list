## Read Data in
*Read in data from rollingstones top albums of all time list. Shown here as "albumlist.csv

## Manipulate and Clean Your Data
*I Impliemented a function that removes unesscary data in this case the categories "subgenre"
*
## Analyze
"will use at least five functions. I know I will use Len() to summarize the amout of decades on my list or similar data. This description will become more detailed as I play aroud with different functions to see what works and what I like.
## Visualize Your Data
Will make bar graph to show what years had the most albums. Also line graph to show the rise of genre's over each year.
## Interpret Your Data
Will add quotes explanning what I did to achieve each result. Will explain what results and new revelations I made with the data. Hard to explain now without seeing it myself but I have a feeling I can draw a lot from what Rolling Stones saw was the best amongst decades and even genres.
